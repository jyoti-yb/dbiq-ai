## 🚀 What is DBIQ AI?

DBIQ AI is an intelligent assistant that:

- monitors Snowflake workloads  
- detects inefficient queries  
- predicts performance risks  
- optimizes queries using AI  
- measures cost & performance impact  
- simulates autonomous warehouse stabilization  

It transforms Snowflake operations from **manual DBA-driven monitoring → AI-driven optimization.**

## 🎯 Problem We Solve

Organizations using Snowflake face:

- slow queries  
- disk spills  
- warehouse blocking  
- rising compute costs  
- heavy DBA dependency  

There is no automation layer to detect and fix issues proactively.

DBIQ AI fills that gap.
